# volume
This is a simple example of how a .wav file can be manipulated via C to increase or decrease the output volume of .WAV file by a factor included as
an option when the file is executed at the command line.

To run this file:
./volume input.wav output.wav 2 //this would increase the output.wav file volume by a factor of 2.
